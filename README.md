# Pipelines with Numpy, Pandas, and Pickle
This repository contains a collection of notebooks demonstrating how to use pipelines in machine learning workflows based on a youtube tutorial. The project is divided into four main notebooks, each highlighting different aspects of working with pipelines using Numpy, Pandas, and Pickle.

# Notebooks
1) Without Pipelines: This notebook covers the basic workflow without using pipelines, utilizing Numpy, Pandas, and Pickle for data manipulation and model serialization.
2) Predict Without Pipelines: Demonstrates the prediction process without pipelines, using Pickle and Numpy for model loading and prediction.
3) Using Pipelines: Introduces the use of pipelines for a streamlined workflow, employing Numpy, Pandas, and Pickle.
4) Predict With Pipelines: Shows how to make predictions using pipelines, leveraging Pickle and Numpy for model loading and prediction within a pipeline structure.

# Dataset
The project uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to illustrate the concepts.

# Installation
Install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy
